he's a smuggler.  on the first cruise  someone brings the contraband to his cabin  and he hides it in an air conditioning duct. returning to the us  he leaves without the contraband  and so passes through customs with no trouble.  on the second trip  he has the same cabin on the same ship.  because it doesn't stop anywhere  he doesn't have to go through customs when he returns  so he gets the contraband off safely
