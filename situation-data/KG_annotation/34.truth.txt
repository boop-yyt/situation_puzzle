let's say "she" is named suzy  and "they" are named harry and jane.  harry is an elderly archaeologist who has found a very old skeleton  which he's dubbed "jane" (a la "lucy").  suzy is a buyer for a museum; she's supposed to make some sort of purchase from harry  so she invites him to have a business dinner with her (at a restaurant).  when she calls to invite him  he keeps talking about "jane " so suzy assumes that jane is his wife and says to bring her along.  harry  offended  calls suzy's boss and complains; since suzy should've known who jane was  she gets fired
