the setting is america during wwii.  greg is a german spy. his "friend" tim is suspicious  so he plays a word-association game with him. when tim says "the land of the free " greg responds with "the home of the brave".  then tim says "the terror of flight " and greg says "the gloom of the grave".  any us citizen knows the first verse of the national anthem  but only a spy would have memorized the third verse.  (why tim knew the third verse is left as an exercise to the reader)
