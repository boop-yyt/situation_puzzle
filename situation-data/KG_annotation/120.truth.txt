the man (a successful artist) has had an accident in which he injured his eyes.  his head is bandaged and he has been warned not to remove the bandages under any circumstances lest the condition be irreversibly aggravated.  he catches the train home from the hospital and cannot resist peeking.  seeing nothing at all  he assumes he is blinded and kills himself in grief.
