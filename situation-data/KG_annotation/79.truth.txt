several men were shipwrecked together.  they agreed to survive by eating each other a piece at a time.  each of them in turn gave up an arm  but before they got to the last man  they were rescued.  they all demanded that the last man live up to his end of the deal.  instead  he killed a bum and sent the bum's arm to the others in a box to "prove" that he had fulfilled the bargain.  later  one of them sees him on the subway  holding onto an overhead ring with the arm he supposedly cut off; the other realizes that the last man cheated  and kills him
