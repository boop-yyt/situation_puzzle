the sole survivor of a shipwreck reached a desert isle. unfortunately  he was blind.  luckily  there was a freshwater spring on the island  and he rigged the ship's bell (which had drifted to the island also) at the spring's location.  the bell rang in the wind  directing him to water.  when he was becalmed for a week  he could not find water again  and so he died of thirst
