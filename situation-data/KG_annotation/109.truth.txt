hans and fritz do everything right up until they're filling out a personal-information form and have to write down their birthdays. fritz' birthday is  say  july 7  so he writes down 7/7/15.  hans  however  was born on  say  june 20  so he writes down 20/6/18 instead of what an american would write  6/20/18.  note that this is only a problem because they *claim* to be returning americans; there are lots of other nations which use the same date ordering
