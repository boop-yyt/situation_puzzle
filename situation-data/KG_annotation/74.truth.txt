the woman is a tightrope walker in a circus.  her act consists of walking the rope blindfolded  accompanied by music  without a net.  the musician (organist  or calliopist  or pianist  or whatever) is supposed to stop playing when she reaches the end of the rope  telling her that it's safe to step off onto the platform.  for unknown reasons (but with murderous intent)  he stops the music early  and she steps off the rope to her death.
