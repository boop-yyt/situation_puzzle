the native chief asked him  "what is the third baseman's name in the abbot and costello routine 'who's on first' ".  the man  who had no idea  said "i don't know " the correct answer.  . however  he was a major smartass  so if he had known the answer he would have pointed out that what was the *second* baseman's name.  the chief  being quite humorless  would have executed him on the spot.
