She stepped off the wire to her death.

1

At the time she went into labor, the twins' mother was travelling from Guam to Hawaii. The older twin, Terry, was born on March 1st. Shortly afterwards, the mother crossed the International Date Line and Kerry, the younger twin, was born. The date was February 28th. In leap years, the younger twin celebrates her birthday two days before the older twin, since February 28 is two days before March 1st.
4.3Fair Shares
Suppose there are a number of people. Pick one person, A, by lot if necessary. Ask A to cut a piece of the cake that he would be happy with as his share. Now go round the
87
group. If B objects then ask B to cut a bit off A's piece so that he (B) would be happy to take what remains. If B does not object ask C and so on. If nobody objects, then let A have that piece. Continuing this process will give a division which satisfies everybody.
4.4The Sealed Envelope
There is usually a small gap at the top of the envelope where the flap has been folded over. The wife inserted a knitting needle through the gap and under the fold of the letter. By rotating the needle she wound the letter tightly around it. She then removed it, read the letter, and replaced it using the actions in reverse.

The men were sailors, who were often flogged for minor offenses on board ship. Some captains refused to whip a man's back if it carried the image of Christ.
4.6Suitcase for Hire

4.7The Tennis Tournament
The answer is 212 matches including the final. There is a very easy way to solve this seemingly difficult problem. Each match must produce one winner and one loser. Everyone except the tournament winner loses exactly once, so the number of matches is exactly the same as the number of losers. So to have 212 losers there must be exactly 212 matches.
4.8The Key

4.11The 88 Hours
The man had a nasty toothache and he went to the dentist at 5 p.m. on a Friday evening. The dentist's assistants, including the anesthetist, had all gone and the dentist could not administer an anesthetic. The man insisted that the dentist should operate even without anesthetic so the dentist said that he would have to strap the man into the chair. This was done. The dentist then suffered a heart attack and died. The poor man was left strapped in the chair and unable to move. It was a holiday weekend and no staff reported for work until 9 a.m. on the following Tuesday morning88 hours later.
4.12Sand Trap
This incident reputedly occurred during the war between Israel and Egypt. Because of import duties, Mercedes cars
89 were much more expensive in Egypt than in Israel. When Israel seized vast tracts of the Sinai desert, a clever Israeli businessman realized that the land would have to be handed back to Egypt after the war. By burying the cars he effectively exported them when the border shifted without them actually moving! His Egyptian associate subsequently sold them at a handsome profit.
4.13Building Demolition
The building was the Australian National Mint. Over many years, so much gold dust had been absorbed into the fabric of the building that it was well worthwhile to demolish the building, extract the gold, and rebuild.
4.14The Tom Cheque
The man had ordered a bicycle for his son as a gift. The advertisement had not stated that it came in 217 pieces as a self-assembly kit. This was his revenge.
4.15The Weather Report
Since the weather report did not specify degrees in Fahrenheit or Celsius/centigrade, the temperature must have been the same in both scales. Only a temperature of -40 degrees is the same in both Fahrenheit and Celsius/ centigrade. That temperature for June would certainly make the place Antarctica.
4.16Odd Animals
They are all impostors:
The koala bear is not a bear; it is a marsupial.
The prairie dog is not a dog; it is a rodent.
The firefly is not a fly; it is a beetle.
90
The silkworm is not a worm; it is a caterpillar.
The jackrabbit is not a rabbit; it is a hare.
The guinea pig is not a pig; it is a rodent (and it is not from Guinea, but from South America).
4.17 The Shorter Program
It was a program of contemporary classical music played from a record. The record was played at the wrong I speed5 rpm instead of 33 rpm. Because of the esoteric nature of the composition, this mistake was not noticed until the end of the transmission. It can easily be calculated that the program should have lasted thirty minutes.
4.18 Traffic Trouble
A new traffic regulation, designed to encourage car sharing, stated that only cars carrying two or more passengers could use certain lanes of the freeway. This led to motorists buying blow-up dolls to give the appearance that they were carrying passengers!
4.19 Blackmail
The criminal sent an invoice to a blind man who had recently died. His widow immediately knew that it must be a scam.
4.20 A Good Night's Sleep
The man was deaf. He had to get up early for an important meeting and he was so worried about oversleeping that he could not get to sleep. After opening the curtains, however, he knew that the sunlight would wake him up, so he was no longer worried and fell asleep easily.
4.21Grateful for Poor Service
The man wanted to buy a first-class ticket on the maiden voyage of the luxury liner Titanic in 1912. He was refused because he was black. The Titanic sank with great loss of life.
4.22Free T-shirts
This is a true story from Connecticut. The advertisement was a trap for people who used illegal devices to tap into cable television circuits without paying. It was placed by the owners of the cable television network and could be seen only by people using illegal decoders.The "free T-shirt was soon followed by a letter informing them that they were committing a federal crime and imposing a $2000 fine. The recipients had little choice but to pay up.
4.23Bank Robbery I
The bank was on the sixth floor of a tall building. The staff member who struggled free pressed a security button which froze all the elevators. The gang was trapped inside the elevator until the police came to arrest them.
4.24Bank Robbery II
The robbers discovered to their horror that the currency consisted only of freshly minted coins. All shops and banks were alerted to watch out for anyone trying to exchange large amounts of coin, so the gang was reduced to playing slot machines!
4.25A Puzzling Attack
They had been trying to solve a lateral thinking problem this one in fact. When the one posing the problem re- 92
vealed the answer the others beat him up. (In setting this puzzle, always describe the group and the problem poser in terms of the number of men and women in your own group.)
